<p>Fedora OS is one of many distribution of linux kernel by far this is the most stable OS iâ€™ve used, in Ubuntu this typically breaks after 3-4 months of usage and updates, Pop_OS actually lasted 6-7 months before breaking, but Fedora lasted me almost 2 years before breaking on me still usable with cli but had to install a fresh copy of Fedora 34.</p>
