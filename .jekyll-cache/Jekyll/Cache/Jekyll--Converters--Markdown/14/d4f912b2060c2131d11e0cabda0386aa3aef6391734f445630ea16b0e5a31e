<p>Fedora OS is one of many distribution of linux kernel by far this is the most stable OS iâ€™ve used, in Ubuntu this typically breaks after 3-4 months of usage and updates, Pop_OS actually lasted 6-7 months before breaking, but Fedora lasted me almost 2 years before breaking on me still usable with cli but had to install a fresh copy of Fedora 34.</p>

<h1 id="the-issue">The Issue</h1>
<p>The issue that i encounter the most when in comes with linux distro is the kernel update there are times that things might truly break reason may vary, thereâ€™s alot of variable to consider such as hardware compatibility, broken dependency repositories, and other unknown sh*ts but what i encountered is</p>
