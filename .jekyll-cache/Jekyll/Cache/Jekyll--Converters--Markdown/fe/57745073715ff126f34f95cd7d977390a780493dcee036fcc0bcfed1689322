<h3 id="pandemic-shtf">Pandemic SHTF</h3>

<p>The year the Pandemic SHTF, limited access, limited movement, and limited productive things to do. It all started just with subtle cases, deaths, and recoveries on the month January and it went nuts by the month of March, But this situation at hand thereâ€™s a noticable growth on creativity and financial awareness of masses, maybe they realized that they havenâ€™t prepare for this sort of thing or have the capacity to deal with the unemployment and restriction nonetheless i did notice the urge of people to get rid with the boredom of being confined in their own houses, social media and other ways of entertainment are one of many choices we have to get rid of this feeling of boredom. I however want to explore things that iâ€™ve missed for couple of years, since i started working i havenâ€™t had enough time to learn and ponder on the things i like the most which are programming, web development, and business.</p>

<p>I was at the office when the lockdown procedure began in Metro Manila, most of our collegues has a transportation readily available prepared by our company, however they didnâ€™t account that they have employees that lives on the northern area of Metro Manila, most buses we see that day have a Southern Metro Manila Signs and nothing, not 1 transporation vehicle is available for us coming from the nothern metro. Nevertheless i wanted to go home after a long day of work i have to take a rest, but thereâ€™s no public transporation avaible since the lockdown procedure prohibits the operation of public transportation vehicles, Inn order for me to go home, Iâ€™m forced to take the hardway and walked from Buendia Makati to Sampaloc Manila thatâ€™s at least 10km or 7.21 miles distance, luckily the heat of the sun isnâ€™t that harsh at that time.</p>

<p>I started to create a game and a subpar story for it hereâ€™s the link of unfinished game dev <a href="https://github.com/AdrianDucao/Explorer19">Explorer19</a>, i always have this facination of end of the world scenarios, when i was a kid, i love to draw war scenarios with stick figures and i love playing games like Left 4 Dead when i was in elementary, i donâ€™t know about this but i think this quote is true;</p>

<p>This is the day iâ€™ve decided with my best of friends to register a business for our new venture, <a href="https://rpointsolution.com">RPOINT IT SOLUTIONS</a>, since itâ€™s the height of pandemic we can only do and move so much so thereâ€™s that weâ€™ll have to work it out until the end of 2021.</p>
