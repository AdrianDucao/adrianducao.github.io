<p>Fedora OS is one of many distribution of linux kernel by far this is the most stable OS iâ€™ve used, in Ubuntu this typically breaks after 3-4 months of usage and updates, Pop_OS actually lasted 6-7 months before breaking, but Fedora lasted me almost 2 years before breaking on me still usable with cli but had to install a fresh copy of Fedora 34.</p>

<h1 id="issue-and-troubleshooting">Issue and Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>The issue that i encounter the most when in comes with linux distro is the kernel update there are times that things might truly break reason may vary, thereâ€™s alot of variable to consider such as hardware compatibility, broken dependency repositories, and other unknown sh*ts.</p>

<p>After the update from Fedora 33 to Fedora 34 everything seems fine or issue, 2 months after the system upgrade i noticed a sluggish load time of my computer, my bootdrive is encrypted so whenever computer boots up you need to enter the passphrase, typical it will only take less than 5 seconds to load and youâ€™ll be directed to login asking for passwordâ€¦ but this time the load time after passphrase input took 1-3 minutesâ€¦ a noticable differenceâ€¦ i worried that my M.2 SSD is dying but thatâ€™s not the issue since after a day or two boot stucked at</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>....
[OK] starting GNOME display manager

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>then i know somethings up, pressed</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Ctrl+Alt+F2
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>in order for me to access tty2 so i can at least access a terminal and voala! at last i was able to login on a terminal to check things upâ€¦ tried to</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo dnf update
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>if something broke last update then this might resolve said issue and remove the potential broken dependencies and fix the bootup issueâ€¦ but thereâ€™s an Error on downloading packages it seemed that iâ€™m not connected to the internet even though my Ethernet is plugged in on my machineâ€¦</p>

<p>tried to</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ping google.com
ping: google.com: Name or service not known
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At first i tought that the motherboard might have some issue but then i remembered that i have my network manager set to automatically connect to my VPN when connecting to the internet not sure why my system canâ€™t connect to my VPN server i tried to</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ nm-connection-editor
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>but it wonâ€™t pull up since thereâ€™s no GUI, took me a while to do research and realized that i can use nmcliâ€¦
Checking ethernet adapters with</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ nmcli con
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>i was able to confirm that ethernet is not connected and had to</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ nmcli con add ethernet
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>to test if i was able to connect to the internet</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ping google.com

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>it seemed connected but with a 100% packet loss is uselessâ€¦ but tried to test it anyway by running an update</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo dnf update
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>the update went through and rebooted my machineâ€¦ but still getting the same issue on boot and the load time is much worse since itâ€™s taking at least 4-5 minutesâ€¦</p>

<p>Tried to check the update history to see if i can revert back some of the updates done</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo dnf history --reverse

...showed the update and installation history...

$ sudo dnf history undo &lt;id&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>but after several tries and restarts things not getting better, still the same issueâ€¦</p>

<p>The only thing that i could think off is to revert or downgrade the current version of my distro to Fedora 33</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo dnf system-upgrade download  --releasever=33 --allowerasing --skip-broken
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>finalising the downgrade</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo dnf system-upgrade reboot
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>i encountered another issue stating that thereâ€™s a <code class="highlighter-rouge">missing shared file Libip4tc.so.2</code>
after much research and digging about this error found couple unanswered and unresolved queries in StackOverflow and some fedora forums i fanally decided to give up.</p>

<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>Logged in to my cherrypi-server and created a bootable Fedora 34 flash drive out of the iso file downloaded from their website and installed a fresh Fedora 34 on my M.2 SSD boot driveâ€¦ all files important data are archived to seperate 2TB HDD, 1 TB HDD, and Projects files are safe and sound on my 250GB SSD.</p>

<h1 id="theory">Theory</h1>
<p>after much discussion in a fedora forum they asked if i could boot to the other kernel saved up since whenver thereâ€™s an kernel update the older kernel are set aside and saved as a backup use incase the latest kernel had an issue, in total there are 3 different kernel versions on your bootdrive ready to be used but i did try to use 3 of those kernel version and still got the same issue at the end, Kernel Version are 5.13.xx, 5.12.xx, and 5.11.xx, i could have troubled to use download older kernel versions compile it and install but it would be much safer to install a fresh copy for security reasons, we concluded that there might be an update that broke the kernel version since Fedora 34 was just release back on April 2021, it is farely new and this point</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>If ainâ€™t broke donâ€™t fix it, if it breaks and canâ€™t be fixed replace it.</p>

<p>Happy Coding.</p>
