<p>Fedora OS is one of many distribution of linux kernel by far this is the most stable OS iâ€™ve used, in Ubuntu this typically breaks after 3-4 months of usage and updates, Pop_OS actually lasted 6-7 months before breaking, but Fedora lasted me almost 2 years before breaking on me, the reason why fedora is stable is due to the huge support of developers who maintain the kernel and is backed by redhat which youâ€™ll get a steady updates is providing bleeding edge technology and since Fedora has one of the largest community most if not all issues has been addressed, reported, or experienced everysingle kind of breaks to be able to provide solutions, and since Fedora is following the spirit of software freedom and open source philosophy which makes them actively refuse to include proprietary programs and would rather prefer open sourced software instead.</p>
