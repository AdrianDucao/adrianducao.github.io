<p>Iâ€™m an Undergrad of Bachelor of Science in Information Techonology, who loves to know how the world works and what makes the world tick. I enjoy learning stuff that for some seemed to be boring, i like theoretical talks but i really love getting my hands dirty since iâ€™m a hands on kind of guy, currently working on a Corporate Job but my passion still lies on Programming, Web Development, Electronics, Mechatronics, and research on Biology.</p>
