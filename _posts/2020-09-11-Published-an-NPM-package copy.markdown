### Issue:
I can't use normal javascript windows.sessionStorage or localStorage in nodejs.

### Solution:
I create an npm package since i couldn't find a solution.

### Resources:
[Github Repo](https://github.com/AdrianDucao/sessionStorage-for-node)

[NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sessionstorage-for-nodejs)

Happy Coding.
